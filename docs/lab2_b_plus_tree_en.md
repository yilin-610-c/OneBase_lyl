# Lab 2: B+ Tree Index

## 1. Overview

The goal of this lab is to implement a complete **B+ Tree Index** for the OneBase database. The B+ Tree is the most widely used index structure in relational databases -- it supports efficient point queries and range queries, with O(log n) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion.

You will implement the following four components:

1. **Internal Page** (`src/storage/page/b_plus_tree_internal_page.cpp`) -- B+ Tree internal node page
2. **Leaf Page** (`src/storage/page/b_plus_tree_leaf_page.cpp`) -- B+ Tree leaf node page
3. **B+ Tree** (`src/storage/index/b_plus_tree.cpp`) -- Core B+ Tree operations (search, insert, delete)
4. **B+ Tree Iterator** (`src/storage/index/b_plus_tree_iterator.cpp`) -- Sequential traversal of leaf nodes

## 2. Background

### 2.1 B+ Tree Structure

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │  Internal   │
                    │  [_, 5, 10] │        key[0] is invalid
                    │ p0  p1  p2  │        value[i] is child page_id
                    └──┬────┬────┬┘
                       │    │    │
           ┌───────────┘    │    └───────────┐
           ▼                ▼                ▼
    ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐
    │   Leaf       │ │   Leaf       │ │   Leaf       │
    │ [1,2,3,4]   │→│ [5,6,7,8,9] │→│ [10,11,12]  │
    │  v v v v     │ │  v v v v v  │ │  v  v  v    │
    └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘
         next_page_id →    next_page_id →    INVALID
```

**Key Properties:**
- All data is stored in leaf nodes
- Internal nodes only store routing keys + child pointers
- Leaf nodes are linked via `next_page_id_` forming a singly linked list
- The `array_[0].first` (first key) of an internal node is invalid; only `array_[0].second` (pointer) is valid

### 2.2 Page Layout

Each B+ Tree node is stored in a database page. The memory layout of a page is as follows:

```
┌─────────────────── Page (4096 bytes) ────────────────────┐
│                                                          │
│  BPlusTreePage header:                                   │
│    page_type_     (IndexPageType: LEAF or INTERNAL)      │
│    size_          (current number of key-value pairs)     │
│    max_size_      (maximum capacity)                      │
│    parent_page_id_ (parent node page_id)                  │
│                                                          │
│  [Leaf only] next_page_id_  (next leaf node)              │
│                                                          │
│  array_[0]:  { key_0, value_0 }                          │
│  array_[1]:  { key_1, value_1 }                          │
│  ...                                                     │
│  array_[n-1]: { key_{n-1}, value_{n-1} }                 │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Important Details:**
- `array_[0]` uses the C flexible array member trick (declared as `std::pair<KeyType, ValueType> array_[0]`)
- The actual usable array size is determined by `max_size_`, using `reinterpret_cast` to treat the Page's `data_` region as the node
- For internal nodes: `ValueType` = `page_id_t` (child page ID)
- For leaf nodes: `ValueType` = `RID` (record identifier)

### 2.3 Split and Merge

**Split:** Triggered when `size > max_size` after insertion into a node

```
Before split (leaf, max_size=4):
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]     <- size=5 > max_size=4, split required

After split:
  Original node: [1, 2]       <- keep the first half
  New node:      [3, 4, 5]    <- second half moves to new node
  Push up: key=3 to parent node
```

**Merge:** Triggered when `size < min_size` after deletion from a node
- `min_size` = `max_size / 2` (leaf nodes) or `(max_size + 1) / 2` (internal nodes)
- First attempt to **Redistribute** from a sibling node
- If the sibling is also not rich enough, **Merge** the two nodes

### 2.4 KeyComparator

The B+ Tree is a template class `BPlusTree<KeyType, ValueType, KeyComparator>`. The default instantiation in this project is:
- `KeyType` = `int`
- `ValueType` = `RID`
- `KeyComparator` = `std::less<int>`

`comparator(a, b)` returns `true` meaning `a < b`.

### Task 3: B+ Tree Core Operations

**File:** `src/storage/index/b_plus_tree.cpp`

| Method | Description | Difficulty |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| `IsEmpty()` | Check whether the tree is empty | ★☆☆ |
| `GetValue(key, result)` | Exact key lookup | ★★☆ |
| `Insert(key, value)` | Insert key-value, handle splits | ★★★★ |

> **Note:** The current iterator design does not include a `BufferPoolManager*` member, which means the iterator cannot fetch pages through BPM. If you need to traverse across leaf nodes, you will need to modify the iterator header file to add the necessary member variables.

## 3.1 Student Implementation Scope

Students are expected to complete the B+ tree implementation in these files:

- `src/storage/page/b_plus_tree_internal_page.cpp`
  Complete page-local operations such as lookup, insert/remove inside the page, split helpers, and redistribution helpers.
- `src/storage/page/b_plus_tree_leaf_page.cpp`
  Complete ordered insert/remove, exact lookup, split helpers, merge helpers, and leaf-to-leaf movement.
- `src/storage/index/b_plus_tree.cpp`
  Complete `Insert`, `Remove`, `GetValue`, `Begin()`, and `Begin(key)`, including root creation, split propagation, merge/redistribution, and root adjustment.
- `src/storage/index/b_plus_tree_iterator.cpp`
  Complete iterator dereference and increment so leaf pages can be scanned in key order.

The expected outcome of Lab 2 is that students can:

- maintain sorted keys inside internal and leaf pages,
- preserve parent pointers and the leaf linked list during structural changes,
- handle root split and root shrink correctly,
- support point lookup, insert/delete rebalancing, and sequential iteration.

## 4. Implementation Notes

- Keep the node header fields, sizes, and parent links consistent whenever a page changes.
- Preserve sorted order inside each page and maintain the leaf-level linked list.
- Handle root split, root shrink, redistribution, and merge cases explicitly.
- Always fetch pages through the buffer pool and unpin them after use.
- The iterator should move across leaf pages without exposing internal page layout details.

## 5. Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the project
cd build && cmake --build . -j$(nproc)

# Run Lab 2 related tests
ctest --test-dir build -R b_plus_tree_internal_page_test --output-on-failure
ctest --test-dir build -R b_plus_tree_leaf_page_test --output-on-failure
ctest --test-dir build -R b_plus_tree_test --output-on-failure
ctest --test-dir build -R b_plus_tree_iterator_test --output-on-failure

# Run all tests
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

### Debugging Tips

- Use print statements to output the tree structure: traverse each level and print keys and sizes
- Test simple sequential insertions first, then out-of-order/random insertions
- Implement `GetValue` + `Insert` (without split) first to verify basic functionality
- Then add split logic
- Finally implement deletion (the most complex part)

## 6. Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting to UnpinPage**: After every `FetchPage` or `NewPage`, the page must be unpinned with `UnpinPage` when done. Missing this will cause buffer pool overflow
2. **Internal node key[0] is invalid**: The `array_[0].first` of an internal node does not store a valid key; only `array_[0].second` (child page pointer) is valid. Key traversal starts from index=1
3. **Forgetting to update parent pointers after split**: The children of newly created nodes have not had their `parent_page_id_` updated
4. **Leaf node linked list maintenance**: When splitting a leaf node, the new node's `next_page_id_` should point to the original node's old `next_page_id_`, and the original node's `next_page_id_` should be updated to the new node's page_id
5. **Choosing the key to push up during split**:
   - Leaf split: push up the first key of the new node (the key is still retained in the leaf)
   - Internal split: push up the middle key (the key is removed from the internal node)
6. **Merge direction**: When merging, make sure to update the parent node's key and child pointers, as well as the `parent_page_id_` of the merged node's children
7. **Root node special handling**: Deletion may cause the root node to have only one child remaining; in this case, the child should be promoted to become the new root
8. **Difference between max_size and min_size**: During insertion, check `size > max_size` (insert first, then check); during deletion, check `size < min_size`
